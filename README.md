## 📖 Overview
**Global Growth AI** is a production-grade economic simulator designed for policy analysts and strategic planners. It combines a **Random Forest Regression Model** for quantitative forecasting with **Llama 3.1 (via Groq)** for qualitative strategic analysis.

**Version 2.7** introduces **Automatic Authentication (Auto-Auth)**, enhanced security protocols, and logic-locked policy sliders to ensure realistic simulations.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Dual-Core AI System
* **Quantitative:** Random Forest model predicts GDP growth based on educational inputs (Primary/Secondary Enrollment and Human Capital Index).
* **Qualitative:** Integrated **Llama 3.1** (via Groq API) acts as a Senior Economic Analyst, answering complex questions about the simulation data.

### 🛡️ Enterprise Security
* **Auto-Auth:** Automatically connects to AI services using Cloud Secrets (no manual key entry required).
* **Secure Fallback:** Provides a secure password field for local testing with pre-filled developer keys.

### 📊 Advanced Simulation
* **Time-Series Forecasting:** Dynamic projection slider (2025–2030).
* **Logic Constraints:** Secondary enrollment sliders are physically locked to never exceed Primary enrollment, ensuring data integrity.
* **G20 Support:** Real-time World Bank data for 20+ major economies.
